# ProfiStudent
Description

ProfiStudent is designed to simulate the generation of student course interaction data for a learning platform. The script generates random student-course interactions such as video watching, quiz completions, assignments submitted, etc. The data is then streamed to Apache Kafka for processing and also uploaded to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for storage. This project serves as an example of how to handle and process educational interaction data in a real-time streaming environment.
